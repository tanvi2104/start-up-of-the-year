# start-up-of-the-year
# so this was a project for my ZTM full stack masterclass
# in this we made a website which asks you to sign up for the start up of the year
# after clicking on the sign up button, it takes you to another page for the sign up procedure
# after signing up with authentic email id
# it saves your information and signs you in
# the website is made with only html and css
# i'm thinking of adding some javascript too to make it more functional and interactive
